<h1 align="center">Cove Creations</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://covecreations-db940de5c766.herokuapp.com/)

Cove Creations is an idea I formed with the help of a close family member who has a passion for home crafts and painting.
The goal is to create a platform to display various items and paintings for sale, and to provide a robust, easy to use, 
lovely to look at, and welcoming site for those interested in crafts

## Business Plan:

## Summary:

- Cove Creations goal is to mainly cater to the crafts and gifts market. More so these days than ever people
are appreciating unique, custom, and handmade products more than ever, rather mass produced cookie cutter products.

- The ultimate goal is to provide a welcoming easy to use website, that users can browse at their leasure, 
find a product that interests them, make a purchase, register for an account, view their profile, update their details,
and so on.

### 

- The origin of this idea came from mutual conversation with an artistic family member, they have a passion for
art, crafts, pottery, creating, and are very talented in making their items feel like a huge amount of care is 
taken in each individual order

- The target market for is, in a wide array, the gifts market, and in scope, for indivduals looking for unique
and interesting products either for themselves or for a loved one.

## Products and services

- Our products range from unique, non repeatable paintings, candles of all variety (Scented, Melts, & Non-Scented)
and pottery such as mugs, plates and vases

- Our unique selling point is simply the love and quality gon in to each product, great levels of care and effort go into
each item, and it shows. Often it's to just get someone a voucher, socks or some bodywash, but with our items your loved one
is sure to appreciate the level of thought gone into each product

### Organization and Management

- The business will be divided very simply, I will work on the technical side, website creation, marketing
and treding research, and my sister will focus solely on the creative side, making the products, creating
new ideas, and fufilling orders

### User Stories

 - #### First Time Visitor Goals

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find products.

        - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to create an account.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log in/out.

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see products.

        - As a Returning Visitor, I want to  be able to view products reviews to help with my purchase


- #### Frequent User Goals

        - As a Frequent User, I want to be kept up to date with a newsletter.

        - As a Frequent User, I want to updaye my profile details as they change
        
        - As a Frequent User, I want to be able to keep a basket with saved items.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The two main colours used are black and white, with accented images and text design. The site contains many product
        images to color and design was kept simple to steer the users attention to the products. I feel if I introduce distinct
        or visually distracting colours it will take the users attention from the products

-   #### Imagery
        -  The home page contains a simple background image, and each products has its own image so a user can see 
        the products in question. I decided to go for a simple layout to keep the focus on the products, as they
        are quite pleasing in their own right. I hope to encourage user to explore the site and see everything
        there is on offer

### Agile Methodology

I have strived to use agile methodolgy throughout this project as planning in advance has made the over all project easier to
manage, I have learned the importance of breaking the project into smaller individual tasks, the use of a kanban board
has also been a great asset as it makes visualizing the tasks at hand much easier

The project board was divided into 3 sections:

  -  To-Do

  -  In Progress

  -  Done-
