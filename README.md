<h1 align="center">Cove Creations</h1>

[View the live project here.]()

Cove Creations is an idea I formed with the help of a close family member who has a passion for home crafts and painting.
The goal is to create a platform to display various items and paintings for sale, and to provide a robust, easy to use, 
lovely to look at, and welcoming site for those interested in crafts

### Agile Methodology
I have strived to use agile methodolgy throughout this project as planning in advance has made the over all project easier to
manage, I have learned the importance of breaking the project into smaller individual tasks, the use of a kanban board
has also been a great asset as it makes visualizing the tasks at hand much easier

The project board was divided into 3 sections:

  -  To-Do
  -  In Progress
  -  Done-
